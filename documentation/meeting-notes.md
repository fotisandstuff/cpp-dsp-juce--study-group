- Progress:
  - Fotis followed along some The Audio Programmer tutorials, but got stuck, and we helped him get unstuck. He’ll continue with the tutorials and think about some synth ideas.
  - Cwits found a library able to communicate with Push from a Raspberry Pi. He also found some algorithms like delay and filters. He’ll now try to connect the controller code to the audio-processing code.
  - Leandro found a way to compute RMS with JUCE. It turns out that it may not give the control necessary for the automixer to work (bigger window sizes independent of the buffer size). He’ll now come up with a custom RMS computation.

- We talked about our goals.
  - **Fotis:** Learn how synthesizers work, for example, what makes a synth from brand X different from brand Y. Explore CLAP.
  - **Victor:** Learn how the mathematics, music, and code come together. Build a custom livelooping that works well for accompanying monophonic instruments (flute).
  - **Tom:** Build a standalone application with PulseAudio, instead of a plugin that’s loaded into a DAW. Build delays & reverbs for guitar. Build an instrument similar to theremin that’s controlled with something like a Leap Motion.
  - **Cwits:** Learn how the mathematics, music, and code come together. Build basic plugins like delays.
  - **Leandro:** Develop a version of his [Automixer](https://github.com/leafac/reaper/tree/da940056c122ceb7f8d7f23499afef451c5fd8ae#automixer) that works in every DAW.
- We reported success in building the basic example code given by APIs/frameworks of choice.
- We looked at the basic example code generated by Projucer and discussed the lifecycle of a plugin and some C++.
- We chose a task that will take us towards our goals that’s small enough we can finish it until next meeting (2022-03-01).

[**Meeting**](https://youtu.be/FutGtjbElBA)

We started by introducing ourselves. We have some people who are new to programming, and so people who are authors of C++ programming books(!)

**Logistics**

We’ll meet every 15 days for about 1~1.5h. We’ll communicate on Discord, Skype, and over here on this GitHub repository, where we’ll also share the code we end up writing.

**Materials**

- YouTube videos & channels to check:
  - Awesome introductions to how audio is represented digitally that clears up some misconceptions: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIQ9IXSUzuM>
  - Another video by the same person, which covers other kinds of digital signals (images and videos): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG9jemV1T7I>
  - Excellent practical demonstrations of some basic concepts such as aliasing distortion, sampling rates, and so forth, and practical aspects when dealing with music production: <https://www.youtube.com/c/DanWorrall> & <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxihtGe18Br6U8RuYCt-hDw>
  - Our own channels, in which we’ve been live-coding audio effects for almost a year, but using REAPER’s JSFX, not C++:
    - <https://www.youtube.com/c/IDDQDMusic>
    - <https://www.youtube.com/c/leafac>
- Victor’s book on C++: <https://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/CompEdu/pdf/isp/EijkhoutIntroSciProgramming-book.pdf>
- An introductory book on Digital Signal Processing: <http://www.dspguide.com/>
  - Great explanations.
  - Suitable for beginners.
  - A bit old, so take the parts about hardware with a grain of salt.
- _Designing Audio Effect Plug-Ins in C++_, by Will Pirkle. A book recommended by [Justin Johnson](https://github.com/Justin-Johnson), of [ReEQ](https://github.com/Justin-Johnson/ReJJ) fame.

**Goals for Next Week**

- Setting an objective. Examples: Making a synthesizer, making a compressor, contributing to an existing open-source project, learning how a reverb works.
- Digital Signal Processing:
  - Have a basic understanding of Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) and what some audio effects do: EQ, compression, delay, reverb, distortion, and so forth.
  - Understand how digital audio is represented: floating points, sampling rates, bit depths, frequency, amplitude, audio-to-digital conversation and digital-to-audio conversion, DC, Nyquist frequency, aliasing, time-domain vs frequency domain, and so forth.
  - How to make sense of what’s displayed in an oscilloscope (time-domain) and on a frequency spectrum analyzer (frequency domain).
  - Get a point where the first chapter of _Designing Audio Effect Plug-Ins in C++_ makes sense.
- Programming:
  - Setting up a project for an audio plugin, getting it to compile, and running it inside a DAW. Either using JUCE or something else.
